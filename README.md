1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AyBank.git
    ```
   
2. Compile and run the project using your preferred Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse). The project uses **Java Swing** for the GUI.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- Java Swing library (included by default in most Java environments)
- IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for development

## Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **`src/`**: Contains the Java source code.
    - **`models/`**: Contains classes for handling user data (e.g., `Customer`, `Employee`, `Manager`).
    - **`views/`**: Contains the Swing-based UI components for login, account management, etc.
    - **`controllers/`**: Logic for user interactions with the application (e.g., handling login, withdrawal, deposit).
    - **`utils/`**: Utility classes, such as database connections and file handling.

### Backend/API Details
- **Database**: The application interacts with a database to store user and transaction data.
  - The database stores customer, employee, and manager details.
  - The database supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the customers and employees based on their role.
- **API Endpoints** (Backend-related features can be extended later):
  - For the **Manager**, API endpoints can be added to allow for managing employees and customers, including adding, removing, or updating records.
  - For **Customers**, APIs can be designed to perform withdrawal, deposit, transfer money, and apply for credits.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Java**: For backend logic, including transaction management and user handling.
- **MySQL/Database**: For storing user information and transaction records.

## Usage

- **Login**: Users can log in as one of the three roles: customer, employee, or manager. Each role has specific permissions as mentioned above.
- **Manager** can manage employees and customers.
- **Employee** can manage customers.
- **Customer** can perform financial transactions and apply for credit.
